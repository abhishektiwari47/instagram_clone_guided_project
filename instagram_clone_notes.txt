so we tried to signup using email and password and then we simply created a class for this purpose. In a different file.
We authenticated using firebaseAuth and we stored the user related data in db using firebaseFirestore...

he used an image picker method for image selection.
Dart.io is not used because it has some funcionalities which are not assible on the website.

for image we use image_picker package


for uploading image we used a firebasestorage... now one thing, in the signup_screen.dart we have checked for _image to be not null as it was required... (file:_image!)
 InkWell(
            onTap: () async {
              String res = await AuthMethod().signUpUser(
                username: _usernameController.text,
                email: _emailController.text,
                password: _passwordController.text,
                bio: _bioController.text,
                file: _image!,
              );
            },


for creating a snackBar we used 
 ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        SnackBar(
          content: Text(res),
        ),
);


now we are going to do something for managing the users login state...
For this we will take the help of firebase...
